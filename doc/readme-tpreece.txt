This is the tpreece.net fork of Audiere.

As Audiere appears to be a long dormant or dead project, I have forked it to fix some bugs to make it build on modern systems (which I'm currently defining as Ubuntu 12.04, as that's what I'm running to test it with).

A git repository showing all of my changes can checked out as follows:
git clone http://tpreece.net/git/audiere.git

My changes are licenced under the same licence as Audiere itself: the GNU LGPL. Hopefully one day these changes will be merged back into the Audiere main branch.
